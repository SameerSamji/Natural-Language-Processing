    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We write a function that computes vectors with co-occurrence numbers for a number of  words with a given list of 'context' words. As context words we take all words that exceed a specified minimum frequency. KCo-occurrence with rare words will hardly contribute to the comparison between context vectors. Another parameter that needs to be set is the maximum distance between two words to count as co-competition, known as the window size. We proceed sentence by sentence here. This means that the last word of a sentence and the first word of the next sentence are never counted as co-occurring. Note, however, that sentence bondaries are often not taken into account in such procedures. It is not clear whether this has a seriosu impact. Another detail to note is that we first calculate the window size for the competition, and then determine the relevant words in the window. Alternatively, you can first remove all irrelevant words and then determine the words within the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a larger window can compensate for a too small corpus. In addition, a smaller window captures more syntactical properties of a word, while a larger window takes into account broader semantic relationships.\n",

    "Our first attempt still offers various possibilities for optimization. First of all we could not use the simple co-occurrence frequencies but the _Positive Pointwise Mutual Information_ (PPMI). The _Pointwise Mutual Information_ between two words a and b is in principle the ratio between the actual probability that they will occur together and the expected probability that they will occur if their occurrences were independent. We define $pmi(a,b) = log(\\frac{p(ab)}{p(a)p(b)})$. The ppmi(a, b) is now the pmi(a, b) if this value is positive, and otherwise 0. The use of the ppmi is based on the assumption that only the fact that words occur together more often than expected is interesting, while lower probabilities are more likely to be based on coincidence or in any case do not say anything interesting about word pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem with our naive approach was that the vectors are extremely long. The vectors not only need a lot of storage space. Many of the dimensions also contain little or only redundant information. This problem can be solved by using a common dimension reduction process. Below we will use Singular Value Decomposition for this and then use the most important 100 dimensions."
